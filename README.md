# FileSense MVP 🗂️✨  
**Can I delete this?** — a calm way to understand your files.

FileSense is a lightweight, beginner-friendly MVP that helps users understand what a file or folder might be and whether it’s safe to delete. It works using a small mock dataset and does not access real system files.

- Displays a result card with:
  - Friendly file name
  - Original file/folder name
  - Confidence level (High / Medium / Low)
